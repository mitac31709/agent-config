# Official references (URL index)

Public documentation and catalogs useful for agent skills and tooling. This file lists URLs only. It does not copy third-party skill bodies into this repository.

Pinned checkouts of the git repositories live under `external/catalogs/` as submodules. See that directory's README for licenses, commit pins, and why a checkout is not the same as enabling a product.

The list is not exhaustive. Entries below are ones this repo already cites, checked as public pages or vendor repositories on 2026-11-06. Confirm a repository is still owned by that vendor before treating it as official.
